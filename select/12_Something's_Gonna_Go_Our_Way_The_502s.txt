Oh it’s been a while since
I saw a smile on your lips
But honey, I’ve been feeling that
something’s gonna go our way
It might be a year from now
Or may be a couple days
You might be feeling down
But that feeling’s gonna change
Ah honey, something’s gonna go our way
I know that it ain’t always easy
It’s ok if we take it day by day
I think that the world might call us crazy
But someday soon something’s gonna go our way
Yeah I can feel it in the air
Down in my bones and everywhere
I don’t know when but God I swear
Something’s gonna go our way
Ah honey, something’s gonna go our way
Ah honey, something’s gonna go our way
I know that it ain’t always easy
It’s ok if we take it day by day
I think that the world might call us crazy
But someday soon something’s gonna go our way
Yeah I can feel it in the air
Down in my bones and everywhere
I don’t know why but God I swear
Something’s gonna go our way
Hey, honey
Something’s gonna go our way
Something’s gonna go our way
